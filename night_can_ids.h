/*
 * Defines the IDs that boards will use for sending and receiving data over CAN.
 * This removes the necessity for us to define a function for everything, but also enables
 * us to be able to manage data easily if any CAN packet/type ever changes!! ðŸ¥°
 *
 * This also means that if something changes on one board, it changes on all of them.
 * Think of TypeScript types but with CAN packets and indexes and C code. Wahoo ðŸ¤ª
